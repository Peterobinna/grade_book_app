# grade_book_app

The Grade Book application is a command-line interface tool designed to manage student records, course enrollments, and academic performance. Developed using Python, the application employs Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, efficient data structures, control flow mechanisms like loops and conditional statements, and functions. The app provides a user-friendly way for the administrator to add students and courses, register students for courses, calculate GPAs, generate transcripts, and perform various search and ranking operations.
